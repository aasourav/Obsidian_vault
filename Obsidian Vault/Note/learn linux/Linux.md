Four main parts make up a Linux system-
	1. The Linux kernel - core Linux system,controls all hardware and software on the computer system, allocate hardware when necessary and executing software when required.
	3. The GNU utilities.
	4. A graphical desktop environment
	5. Application software
Each of these parts has a specific job in the Linux system. No part is very useful by itself.


1.Linux kernel: it's primarily responsible for four main functions: - 
 * System memory management.
 * Software program management.
