**Topology:** It defined how devices are connected to each other and how data flows within a network.

**Bus Topology:** Bus topology is a type of network topology in which all devices are connected to a common communication pathway.

`In a bus topology, collisions can occur when two or more devices attempt to transmit data simultaneously. When a collision happens, the transmitted data gets`

**Star Topology:**  is a network topology where all devices in the network are directly connected to a central node or a central switch. Each device has its own dedicated connection to the central node, and communication between devices occurs through this central point.

**Mesh Topology:** Mesh topology is a network topology in which every device in the network is connected to every other device directly.

**Ring Topology:** Ring topology is a network topology in which devices are connected in a closed loop or ring formation. In this configuration, each device is connected to precisely two neighboring devices, forming a continuous ring structure. The data circulates around the ring in a unidirectional manner, passing from one device to the next until it reaches its destination.
