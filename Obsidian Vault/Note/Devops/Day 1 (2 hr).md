if we want to need help on **Linux command** 
type
		`man which_command_we_want_to_explore`
this command will show me the documentation of this command.

` /search_keyword`   ,   `shift + ` next result
search backward `?search_keyword`

press `g` to go first line of the page

`type command`  it will show me this command is shell build in or executable file or a shell build in . 
if it's show `alias is a shell builtin`

`help shell_builtin_command`   `man` command is only for executable command , and `help` is for builtin commands doc.

another way for common -  `command --help`
