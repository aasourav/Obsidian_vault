After learning [[Introduction to terminal and it's shortcut]]  let's start file system.

### absolute vs relative path

absolute => start from /(foreword slash)   
absolute path : *An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/).*
relative path: *Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd).*

`~/Desktop`  " ~  " means  home directory.
`.` means current directory. `..` means parent directory of current directory
relative path is start from  ex: `./home` 

### `etc` directory contains the configuration of entire system.
