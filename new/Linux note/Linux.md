Certainly! Here’s a table for **Obsidian Note** based on the information from the image:

|**Shortcut**|**Result**|
|---|---|
|`cd`|Changes the working directory to your home directory.|
|`cd -`|Changes the working directory to the previous working directory.|
|`cd ~"user_name"`|Changes the working directory to the home directory of `user_name`. For example, typing `cd "~bob"` will change the directory to the home directory of user “bob”.|

|**Short Option**|**Long Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|-a|--all|List all files, even those with names that begin with a period, which are normally not listed (that is, hidden).|
|-A|--almost-all|Like the -a option except it does not list . (current directory) and .. (parent directory).|
